In collaboration with my fellow classmates, we developed a machine learning-based system to help farmers decide the best crops to plant based on environmental and soil parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

Key Features:
🔍 Data Analysis: Comprehensive analysis and visualization of environmental and soil parameters.
🌱 Crop Recommendation: Accurate machine learning model to suggest the best crops to grow.
💻 Web Interface: Easy-to-use interface for farmers to input data and receive recommendations instantly.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Flask for the web application
- Machine Learning for crop prediction
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend
